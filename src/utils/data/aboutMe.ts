    'I am a full-stack web developer and recent graduate of the Full Stack Web Development Program at Thinkful. From a young age, I have always been inclined to build things and see what I can make. Since coding has come into my life, I have had the opportunity to do just that and create projects from scratch. The feeling of taking an idea and turning it into a fully functional, working application is unparalleled. My technology of choice is the MERN stack and I equally enjoy both frontend and backend development.\n When I am not solving problems, I enjoy piloting my drone and taking videos, catching deep powder on my snowboard, seeing live music, and riding roller coasters.',
